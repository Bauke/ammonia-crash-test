<p>I've investigated hundreds of data breaches over the years (there are 514 of
  them in <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a> as I write
  this), and for the most part, the situation with Gab is just another day on
  the internet. But Gab is also different, having grown dramatically in recent
  months as an alternative to mainstream incumbent platforms such as Twitter and
  Facebook and drawing a crowd primarily focused on right wing American
  politics.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, I posted a thread about their alleged breach. I want to
  go back through that thread here, explain the thinking further and then
  provide some commentary on the actual data that was exposed. It all began
  here:</p>

<p>Much of the problem with objectively discussing this breach is that it's
  impossible to escape the transphobic slurs and religious rhetoric being dished
  out from the guy at the top. I don't care which god (or demon) you've picked,
  nor what gender you were born with (or if you decided to change it at some
  time), nor do I care whose politics you like and whose you don't, I only care
  about the data. More specifically, I care about the data that's been exposed
  in the breach, especially when that data may include my own (I'm very
  serious).</p>

<p>It's pretty standard practice for an organisation to post a public statement
  following a breach or even, as the opening sentence of that page suggest, an
  "alleged" breach. Most organisation begin with "we take the security of your
  data seriously", layer on lawyer speak, talk about credit cards not being
  exposed and then promise to provide further updates as they come to hand.
  Gab's approach... differs:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For example, because they couldn&#39;t find any public
    discussion about the breach they assumed that <a
      href="https://twitter.com/WIRED?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WIRED</a> reporters
    were &quot;essentially assisting the hacker in his efforts to smear our

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Because Gab "searched high and low for chatter on the breach on the Internet
  and found nothing", they've drawn the conclusion that reporters are
  maliciously working with hackers. I've had <em>dozens </em>of occasions where
  I've known about a breach, there's been no public discussion on it, and I've
  worked with reporters to help get to the bottom of what's happened. This is
  normal. It's <em>so</em> normal that the last time I did this was <a

    this week with Lawrence Abrams from Bleeping Computer on the Dutch

<p>If you're not familiar with hashing, how it's not the same as encryption and
  how it can still leave passwords vulnerable, <a
    href="https://www.troyhunt.com/we-didnt-encrypt-your-password-we-hashed-it-heres-what-that-means/">read
    this primer from September first</a>. As it relates to passwords being
  revealed, you can't "unhash" a hash in the same way as you can decrypt an
  encrypted piece of text, however, you can always <em>guess </em>passwords,
  hash them with the same algorithm (and salt if present) and see if the output
  matches what was stored. For example, <a
    href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-dropbox-hack-is-real/">when I wrote about
    the Dropbox hack in 2016</a>, I was able to verify my own record simply by
  hashing the password I had stored in 1Password and comparing the output to the
  one in the breach. It matched, therefore verifying the legitimacy of the
  breach. The following year I showed how <a
    href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-from-connected-cloudpets-teddy-bears-leaked-and-ransomed-exposing-kids-voice-messages/">even
    though CloudPets had chosen the very robust bcrypt algorithm for password
    storage</a>, I was still able to crack a bunch of them courtesy of their
  extremely weak password rules:</p>

<p>I do actually agree with the quoted sentence insofar as someone could create
  an email address completely disassociated with them, register for Gab and then
  login with that account. But that almost never happens because Gab is used by
  normal humans just wanting to interact with other normal humans and it's not a
  platform where people are likely to take extra precautions to conceal their
  true identity. When faced with a registration form that requests an email
  address, the vast majority of people will simply provide the same email
  address they use everywhere else, hence my "almost always" comment.</p>

<p>This isn't an unusual response to a data breach; many companies try to
  downplay the significance in order to reduce the perceived impact of it. <a
    href="https://www.troyhunt.com/good-news-your-credit-card-is-fine-and/">I
    wrote about this in 2015</a>, specifically as it relates to organisations
  focusing on the security of credit cards which are one of the most easily
  replaceable and low-impact classes of data to have exposed. All of the classes
  of data Gab mentions pale in comparison to the impact of having extremist
  messaging exposed in connection to a personally identifiable data attribute
  such as someone's email address. And regardless of your political persuasion,
  it's clear that a platform designed to have a bare minimum of controls on
  content (<a
    href="https://demo-on.gab.com/about/tos#content-standards">although they do
    define content standards</a>) is going to attract and retain more extreme

<p>This is also fairly common to see in a post-breach announcement, either in
  generic terms ("as you know, data breaches are very common") or in Gab's case,
  directly pointing the finger at competing services. The comment is intended to
  normalise the data breach and downplay its significance, the exact opposite of
  what we want to encourage in this industry. A few years ago <a
    href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-breach-disclosure-101-how-to-succeed-after-youve-failed/">I
    wrote about how to construct a breach disclosure notice</a> and paid
  particular attention to how well the Red Cross Blood Service handled theirs.
  It's little things like apologising; rather than downplaying the incident and
  directing attention elsewhere, we need to see organisations standing up,
  copping it on the chin and acknowledging their faults.</p>

<p>I'm amused by this, more than anything. For the most part I thought my
  analysis was pretty objective and Gab (whose account seems to simply be the
  mouthpiece of their CEO, Andrew Torba) hasn't really made it clear which bit
  they disagreed with, so let's solider on and objectively look at the data just
  like with any other data breach.</p>
<p>In a 2.99GB file called accounts.sql, there are just over 4M rows of data
  largely consisting of user records. Because I myself have a Gab account which
  I created when started making commentary on them and Parler in Jan, naturally
  the first thing I did was to pull out my own record:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

    (mine has the former, but not the latter). But for verification, don&#39;t
    those dates and times look... similar. Coincidence? Or real breach? (Aus

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
  charset="utf-8"></script>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Per the tweet, there's no hash against my record so I can't verify the
  password matched the long random one I created in 1Password, but it's
  obviously pretty clear the data is legit based on the alignment of the dates.
  In total, the file has 43,015 unique email addresses (including mine) which is
  a far cry less than the total row count. Why? At a guess it would come down to
  how the data was dumped. There <em>are</em> actually bcrypt password hashes
  against many records, but they also only represent a subset of the total with
  7,097 of them in all. Having access to these hashes gives us an opportunity to
  debunk Gab's earlier claim that "your passwords have not been revealed", an
  exercise that's made particularly easy due to their password criteria which
  can be seen on the registration page:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img
    src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/03/image.png"
    class="kg-image" alt="Gab Has Been Breached"></figure>
<p>Requiring 8 characters isn't unusual (<a
    href="https://www.troyhunt.com/how-long-is-long-enough-minimum-password-lengths-by-the-worlds-top-sites/">it's
    possibly even on the high side</a>), but that's the <em>only </em>criteria.
  What that means is that it's easy to take a list of the most common passwords
  of 8 characters or more, pass them into <a
    href="https://hashcat.net/">hashcat</a> and bingo, "your password has been
  revealed":</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img

    sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>Yes, apparently Gab will let you have a password that is literally
  "password".</p>
<p>Andy mentioned the presence of a chatlog.txt file in his story and the data
  is pretty limited here at only 9.53MB in size. The content ranges from an
  extensive amount of religious scripture to very intimate messaging between 2
  members to someone sharing a radio show which they close with "We hope you
  enjoy the show and share it with white families". To be clear, these are
  intended to be private messages and not something Gab should be responsible
  for moderating (for obviously privacy reasons), but they do give an insight
  into the interests of their members. It also speaks to my earlier point about
  this breach being significant as it ties identities to their messaging. Some
  of the private messages are by most standards, recalcitrant, and they sit
  alongside the Gab username which then exists in the accounts.sql file which
  then points to their online profile and may also include their email address.
  Plus, there are multiple messages in which people have shared their personal
  phone number, often to take the conversation onto WhatsApp. You can
  immediately see the risk to individuals.</p>
<p>The groups.sql file Andy also mentioned is much more benign. It's 31.8MB
  worth of Gab group information spread over nearly 32k lines. I suspect there's
  little risk posed by the exposure of the data other than that it simplifies
  the exercise of analysing the nature of the groups people have created. One
  thing that seeing this file helped me understand is that as much as Gab has
  gained notoriety for housing certain types of content, there's a <em>heap</em>
  of run of the mill stuff that'd barely raise an eyebrow. For example, there's
  <a href="https://gab.com/groups/3122">the German Shepherds group</a>, <a
    href="https://gab.com/groups/748">the brewing group</a> or even <a
    href="https://gab.com/groups/1670">the Dads of Gab group</a> which is all
  about "A group by fathers, for fathers. Topics should be about how to properly
  parent your sons...", ok, good, this is sounding good "...and how to police
  your wives". Aw crap. I honestly tried to focus on the positive but it's very
  hard to go far without running into content which, well, let's just say
  "doesn't sit well with most people". Micah Lee from The Intercept did a quick
  analysis on the largest groups:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>So, what's the harm? Is it a "breach" if it merely exposes data that's public
  by design anyway? Well, it depends, primarily because large volumes of easily
  queryable data downloadable in aggregate can offer a lot more insight than
  manually trawling through individual pages. I don't think this presents any
  (additional) risk or harm to the individual users of Gab who posted public
  content, rather it makes it a hell of a lot easier for researchers to analyse
  and form empirically derived conclusions across large volumes of data. It also
  made it easy for me to identify more email addresses that appeared in public
  comments, 24,017 of them in total. A bunch of those were already in the
  accounts.sql file and a portion were also false positives (email addresses are
  extracted via regular expression and may include other data that matches a
  valid address pattern). But many others appeared in posts, for example a big
  list of UK politicians in a post about "traitors". In total across all files
  in the breach, I identified 66,521 unique addresses. This is obviously only a
  very small subset of the ~4M users of the service and on that basis, it's a
  minor breach in terms of personal information exposure.</p>
<p>And what about the bug that caused all this havoc to begin with? Dan Goodin
  (another infosec journo I respect) wrote up a piece yesterday on <a
    href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/rookie-coding-mistake-prior-to-gab-hack-came-from-sites-cto/">the
    rookie coding mistake made by the site's CTO</a>, namely the presence of SQL
  injection. It might be a simple mistake, but it's also an enormously common
  one and <a
    href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection">still
    rates as the number one application security risk on the web today</a>. It's
  an easy mistake to make, but also an easy one to catch and I can't help
  wondering if its presence reflects a lack of both peer review and automated
  analysis, both of which would likely be neglected by an under-resourced
  company dealing with the massive rate of growth Gab has seen this year.</p>
<p>As I was analysing this data and considering how to approach it with HIBP, I
  was quickly drawing the conclusion that this shouldn't be publicly searchable.
  That view was reinforced by James Roper's tweet:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Curious, will you consider this breach a
    &quot;sensitive&quot; breach? Given that an email addresses presence in the

    I could imagine employers looking up a candidates email address and
    excluding them based on that.</p>&mdash; James Roper (@jroper) <a

<p>James is spot on in that there is a very strong political leaning implied by
  a presence in the data, and likewise a strong religious affiliation to
  Christianity. It differs from place to place but for the most part, <a
    href="https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/for-your-information-australian-privacy-law-and-practice-alrc-report-108/6-the-privacy-act-some-important-definitions/sensitive-information/">both
    political and religious views are classified as sensitive information</a>
  and it's only fair for me to treat the data with that level of respect.
  There's also the risk of incorrectly assuming that a presence in the breach
  implies your views have some degree of alignment with those regularly
  expressed on the site, yet clearly based on the presence of my own email
  address, that assumption is incorrect. If you want to see if your own email
  address is in the Gab breach, you'll need to <a
    href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe">verify that you control it via
    HIBP's notification service</a>. If you use <a
    href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/DomainSearch">the domain search feature</a>
  and can verify that you control the domain, you'll be able to see which
  aliases on that domain appear in the breach. The data is not publicly
  searchable from the front page nor is it available via <a
    href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3">the API</a>.</p>
<p>One final observation based on my time spent trawling through Gab: a platform
  like Facebook is global in nature. <a
    href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/">It's
    approaching 3B monthly active users and a "mere" 190M of them are in the
    US</a>, so call it about 7% of the audience. But 190M is still a huge number
  and within that number are tens of millions of active users with the same
  political alliances as those on Gab. Facebook has many, <em>many</em> flaws,
  but lack of a diverse global audience is not one of them. That's Gab's flaw.
  The content is <em>extremely</em> US-centric (it's difficult to derive from
  the leaked data, but my gut feel is 90%+) and its obviously very much
  right-wing politics. If in any doubt about the singularity of Gab's content,
  <a href="https://gab.com/explore">just browse through the explore page</a>: at
  the time of writing, the first few pieces of content are a climate change
  denying piece, a post deriding those pushing back against the Texas governor
  ending the state-wide mask mandate, a post from a Republican politician
  Wikipedia describes as a "far-right conspiracy theorist", a derogatory piece
  on Mitch McConnell, someone complaining they were censored on Parler and
  posting a Photoshopped image of Biden in front of a Chinese flag, a post from
  "far-right fake news website" (again, Wikipedia's description) about 2020
  election fraud, one claiming the FBI is corrupt and that the KGB is more
  trustworthy... And the trend just continues. Gab isn't a free speech
  alternative to incumbent tech behemoths with a rich collection of wide-ranging
  views, rather it's an echo chamber of the same political, religious and
  scientific opinions.</p>
<p>Gab is now the 515th data breach in HIBP. At the time of writing, I'm yet to
  receive a breach notification about the exposure of my Gab data.</p>
